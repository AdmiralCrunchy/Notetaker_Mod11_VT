## Description

---

This is the 11th module for the University of Washington Coding Bootcamp that is/ was due July 26th, 2022. The challenge was to create an application that can be used to write and save notes. This application used Express.js back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file. The font end of the application was already created and given to me. My duties was build a back end to connect the two and then I had to use Heroku to launch.

## Personal Notes

The main frustration that came from this assignment was 1000% due to Heroku errors that made life difficult. But eventually I was able to get them resolved.
